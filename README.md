                                                                PIZZA RUNNER CASE STUDY

This project addresses the Pizza Runner Case Study questions, focusing on pizza metrics, runner and customer experience, ingredient optimization, pricing and ratings, and bonus DML challenges. 
The goal is to analyze various aspects of the pizza delivery business, from the number of pizzas ordered to customer satisfaction and ingredient usage, using SQL.

Case Study Questions
The case study is divided into the following sections:

A. Pizza Metrics
1. How many pizzas were ordered?

2. How many unique customer orders were made?

3. How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?

4. How many of each type of pizza was delivered?

5. What was the volume of orders for each day of the week?

(And other questions focusing on pizza orders and delivery details.)

B. Runner and Customer Experience

1. How many runners signed up for each week period?

2. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?

3. What was the average speed for each runner during delivery?

(These questions analyze the runner's performance and customer experience metrics.)

C. Ingredient Optimization
1. What are the standard ingredients for each pizza?

2.What is the total quantity of each ingredient used in delivered pizzas?
(These questions examine pizza ingredients and their usage.)

D. Pricing and Ratings

1. How much revenue has Pizza Runner made so far if there are no delivery fees?

2. What if an additional $1 was charged for each extra ingredient?
(These questions evaluate pricing and suggest a new customer ratings system.)

E. Bonus Questions

1. How would the data design change if a new pizza, such as the Supreme with all toppings, was added to the menu?

Project Structure
A. Pizza Metrics: SQL queries related to Pizza Metrics (e.g., order volume, successful deliveries, customer orders).

B. Runner and Customer Experience: SQL scripts analyzing Runner and Customer Experience (e.g., average delivery times, successful deliveries).


C. Ingredient Optimisation: Ingredient Optimization queries (e.g., ingredient usage per order).

D. Pricing and Ratings: Pricing and Ratings analysis (e.g., total revenue, pricing adjustments for extras).

E. Bonus Questions: SQL queries addressing the Bonus Questions (e.g., modifying the data schema to add new pizza types).

How to Use

1. Clone the Repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dannys-diner-case-study.git

2. Run the SQL Scripts: Each SQL file corresponds to different sections of the case study. Execute the scripts in your preferred SQL environment to answer the case study questions.

Requirements

1. A SQL environment (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, BigQuery, or any compatible SQL database).

2. Tables for customer orders, runner orders, and pizza ingredients.

Insights and Analysis
The SQL queries in this project provide insights into:

1. Pizza Metrics: Analysis of pizza orders, customer order frequency, and pizza delivery performance.

2. Runner and Customer Experience: Insights into the speed and efficiency of deliveries, customer satisfaction, and runner performance.

3. Ingredient Usage: Detailed analysis of ingredient quantities used for different pizzas.

4. Pricing and Revenue: Calculations of total revenue with various pricing models and ratings systems.
